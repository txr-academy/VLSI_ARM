This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 m3_for_arty_a7_i/Cortex_M3_0/inst/u_x_dtcm/genblk3[1].ram_block_reg_0_0 has an input control pin m3_for_arty_a7_i/Cortex_M3_0/inst/u_x_dtcm/genblk3[1].ram_block_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: m3_for_arty_a7_i/Cortex_M3_0/inst/u_x_dtcm/ADDRARDADDR[12]) which is driven by a register (m3_for_arty_a7_i/Cortex_M3_0/inst/u_s_AhbSToAxi/uA11AhbLiteMToAxi/iWVALID_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
